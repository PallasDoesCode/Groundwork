Groundwork
==========

In the past, I've used other front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap. However, over time I have felt bad for not taking the time to learn how to create different things for myself such as a tooltip or modal in jQuery. So when I registered for a course where I will be required to work on an indepenent web application, I decided it was time I started expanding my CSS and JavaScript skills and thus Groundwork was born.

At the moment, Groundwork is just a simple jQuery framework containing a tooltip and modal plugin. However, as time goes on I plan to expand Groundwork so to include other plugins and becomes a full fledged CSS and JQuery framework that I can use across all my projects.
